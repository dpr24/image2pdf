Image2PDF is a Flutter application that allows users to convert images from their device's gallery into a PDF file. The app includes features such as setting a password for the generated PDF, reordering selected images, and adding an overlay image/logo to the final PDF file.

## Features

- **Convert Images to PDF**: Select multiple images from the gallery and generate a PDF file.
- **Set Password**: Secure the generated PDF file with a password.
- **Reorder Images**: Drag and reorder selected images before generating the PDF.
- **Add Overlay Image/Logo**: Customize the PDF by adding a watermark or logo to all pages.

- **Print PDF**: Directly print the generated PDF file.
